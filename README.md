# Expense Tracker
# Introduction
  An expense tracker is an application that helps to keep an accurate record of money inflow, outflow and manage personal finance.
  So that people can trace where the money comes in and as well as from where the money goes out. Nowadays many people live on a
  fixed income especially students and other peoples who are apart from their family and stay on their own for studying and
  other purposes. They tend to overspend money without realizing it, and this brings to tragic. Using an expense tracker can
  help people to find out how much money they spend every day and on what. Based on that people can limit expenses and plan
  accordingly. At every end of day or month, people will have a clear understanding of where their money is going and from
  where the money came.

# REST Client: Retrofit and its uses
  Retrofit is a REST Client for Android. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload
  JSON via a REST based webservice. In Retrofit we configure which converter is used for
  the data serialization. Typically for JSON we use GSon, but we can also add custom converters to process XML or other
  protocols. Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests.
